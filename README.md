# cpp programing
Hi there, my name is Bereket Tadiwos. And I'm a junior c++ developer and I was going through this book called "O'Reilly - Practical C++ Programming" (Btw you can check out the book here "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwinyLipx-X8AhVEKuwKHYf1BZsQFnoECAgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Frepo.zenk-security.com%2FProgrammation%2FO%2520Reilly%2520-%2520Practical%2520C%2520Programming%2C%25203rd%2520Edition.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0mHVGDwOyR0LeoOoJ6y6BG") and there are some good exercises so i decided to work them and share with other people. This repository is totally dedicated for the execises in the book.
